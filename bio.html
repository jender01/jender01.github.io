  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <p class = "text"> I was born in Chicago, Illinois, but raised in Madison, Wisconsin, where I
    <br> live with my parents, brother, and dog. I come from a family of athletes, and
    <br> was raised to be a proficient volleyball player, but instead I chose
    <br> my love for the creative arts, particularly drawing and writing, over the
    <br> sports career I was intended for. Now I pursue those passions, plus a
    <br> newfound passion for computer science, at Tufts University. </p>
